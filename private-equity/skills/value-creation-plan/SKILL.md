# Value Creation Plan

description: Structure post-acquisition value creation plans with revenue, cost, and operational levers mapped to an EBITDA bridge. Includes 100-day priorities, KPI targets, and accountability frameworks. Use when planning post-close execution, preparing operating partner materials, or building a board-ready value creation roadmap. Triggers on "value creation plan", "100-day plan", "post-close plan", "EBITDA bridge", "operating plan", or "value creation levers".

## Workflow

### Step 1: Baseline Assessment

Understand the starting point:
- Current revenue, EBITDA, and margins
- Organizational structure and capabilities
- Key operational metrics by function
- Management team strengths and gaps
- Quick wins already identified during diligence

### Step 2: Value Creation Levers

Map all levers to an EBITDA bridge over the hold period:

#### Revenue Growth Levers
- **Organic growth**: Price increases, volume growth, market expansion
- **Cross-sell / upsell**: New products to existing customers
- **New market entry**: Geographic expansion, new verticals, new channels
- **Sales force effectiveness**: Hire reps, improve conversion, shorten cycle
- **M&A / add-ons**: Bolt-on acquisitions to add revenue and capabilities

For each lever:
- Current state → Target state
- Revenue impact ($)
- Timeline to impact
- Investment required
- Confidence level (high/medium/low)

#### Margin Expansion Levers
- **Pricing optimization**: Price increases, mix shift, bundling
- **COGS reduction**: Procurement savings, supplier consolidation, automation
- **OpEx optimization**: Overhead reduction, shared services, offshoring
- **Technology investment**: Automation, systems integration, data analytics
- **Scale leverage**: Fixed cost leverage as revenue grows

#### Strategic / Multiple Expansion
- **Platform building**: Add-on acquisitions, tuck-ins
- **Recurring revenue shift**: Move from project to recurring/subscription
- **Market positioning**: Category leadership, brand building
- **Management upgrades**: Key hires to professionalize the business
- **ESG / governance**: Board formation, reporting improvements

### Step 3: EBITDA Bridge

Build the walk from current to target EBITDA:

| Lever | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Base EBITDA | | | | | |
| Organic revenue growth | | | | | |
| Pricing | | | | | |
| Add-on M&A | | | | | |
| COGS savings | | | | | |
| OpEx optimization | | | | | |
| Technology investment | | | | | |
| **Pro Forma EBITDA** | | | | | |
| **Margin** | | | | | |

### Step 4: 100-Day Plan

Prioritize the first 100 days post-close:

**Days 1-30: Stabilize & Assess**
- Management alignment and retention (sign employment agreements, set comp)
- Quick wins — pricing, obvious cost cuts, low-hanging fruit
- Detailed operational assessment by function
- Customer communication plan
- Set up reporting and KPI dashboards

**Days 31-60: Plan & Initiate**
- Finalize strategic plan and communicate to organization
- Launch top 3-5 value creation initiatives
- Begin add-on M&A pipeline development
- Hire for critical gaps
- Implement new reporting cadence (weekly flash, monthly review, quarterly board)

**Days 61-100: Execute & Measure**
- First results from quick-win initiatives
- First board meeting with operating metrics
- Progress report on each value creation lever
- Adjust plan based on early learnings

### Step 5: KPI Dashboard

Define the metrics that will track value creation:

| KPI | Current | Year 1 Target | Owner | Reporting Frequency |
|-----|---------|---------------|-------|-------------------|
| Revenue | | | CEO | Monthly |
| EBITDA | | | CFO | Monthly |
| EBITDA margin | | | CFO | Monthly |
| New customer wins | | | CRO | Weekly |
| Net retention | | | CRO | Monthly |
| Employee turnover | | | CHRO | Monthly |
| Cash conversion | | | CFO | Monthly |

### Step 6: Output

- Word document or PowerPoint with:
  - Executive summary (1 page)
  - EBITDA bridge chart
  - Value creation levers detail (1 page per lever)
  - 100-day plan timeline
  - KPI dashboard
  - Accountability matrix (who owns what)
- Excel model backing the EBITDA bridge

## Important Notes

- Be realistic about timing — most PE value creation takes 12-24 months to show in financials
- Quick wins matter for momentum and credibility, but don't over-rotate on cost cuts at the expense of growth
- Management buy-in is critical — co-develop the plan, don't impose it
- Track initiative-level P&L impact, not just top-line EBITDA — you need to know what's working
- Add-on M&A is often the largest value creation lever — start the pipeline on Day 1
- Always pressure-test assumptions with operating partners or industry experts
