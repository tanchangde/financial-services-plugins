# Financial Data Pack Builder

Build professional, standardized financial data packs for private equity, investment banking, and asset management. Transform financial data from CIMs, offering memorandums, SEC filings, web search, or MCP server access into polished Excel workbooks ready for investment committee review.

**Important:** Use the xlsx skill for all Excel file creation and manipulation throughout this workflow.

## CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

Every data pack must achieve these standards. Failure on any point makes the deliverable unusable.

### 1. Data Accuracy (Zero Tolerance for Errors)
- Trace every number to source document with page reference
- Use formula-based calculations exclusively (no hardcoded values)
- Cross-check subtotals and totals for internal consistency
- Verify balance sheet balances: Assets = Liabilities + Equity
- Confirm cash flow ties to balance sheet changes

### 2. ESSENTIAL RULES

**RULE 1: Financial data (measuring money) → Currency format with $**
Triggers: Revenue, Sales, Income, EBITDA, Profit, Loss, Cost, Expense, Cash, Debt, Assets, Liabilities, Equity, Capex
Format: $#,##0.0 for millions, $#,##0 for thousands
Negatives: $(123.0) NOT -$123

**RULE 2: Operational data (counting things) → Number format, NO $**
Triggers: Units, Stores, Locations, Employees, Customers, Square Feet, Properties, Headcount
Format: #,##0 with commas
Negatives: (123) consistent with rest of table

**RULE 3: Percentages (rates and ratios) → Percentage format**
Triggers: Margin, Growth, Rate, Percentage, Yield, Return, Utilization, Occupancy
Format: 0.0% for one decimal place
Display: 15.0% NOT 0.15

**RULE 4: Years → Text format to prevent comma insertion**
Format: Text or custom to prevent 2,024
Display: 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023A, 2024E

**RULE 5: When context is mixed, each metric gets its own appropriate format**
Example:
```
Segment Analysis, 2022, 2023, 2024
Retail Revenue, $50.0, $55.0, $60.0
  Stores, 100, 110, 120
  Revenue per Store, $0.5, $0.5, $0.5
```
Revenue and per-store metrics use $, Store count uses number format.

**RULE 6: Use formulas for all calculations → Never hardcode calculated values**
All subtotals, totals, ratios, and derived metrics must be formula-based, not hardcoded values. This ensures accuracy and allows for dynamic updates.

### 3. Professional Presentation Standards

**Formatting Standards:**

**Color Scheme - Two Layers:**

**Layer 1: Font Colors (MANDATORY from xlsx skill)**
- **Blue text (RGB: 0,0,255)**: ALL hardcoded inputs (historical data, assumptions), NOT normal text
- **Black text (RGB: 0,0,0)**: ALL formulas and calculations
- **Green text (RGB: 0,128,0)**: Links to other sheets

**Layer 2: Fill Colors (Optional for enhanced presentation)**
- Fill colors are optional and should only be applied if requested by the user or if enhancing presentation
- If the user requests colors or professional formatting, use this standard scheme:
  - **Section headers**: Dark blue (RGB: 68,114,196) background with white text
  - **Sub-headers/column headers**: Light blue (RGB: 217,225,242) background with black text
  - **Input cells**: Light green/cream (RGB: 226,239,218) background with blue text
  - **Calculated cells**: White background with black text
- Users can override with custom brand colors if specified

**How the layers work together (if fill colors are used):**
- Input cell: Blue text + light green fill = "User-entered data"
- Formula cell: Black text + white background = "Calculated value"
- Sheet link: Green text + white background = "Reference from another tab"

**Font color tells you WHAT it is. Fill color tells you WHERE it is (if used).**

**IMPORTANT:** Font colors from xlsx skill are mandatory. Fill colors are optional - default is white/no fill unless the user requests enhanced formatting or colors.

**Always apply:**
- Bold headers, left-aligned
- Numbers right-aligned
- 2-space indentation for sub-items
- Single underline above subtotals
- Double underline below final totals
- Freeze panes on row/column headers
- Minimal borders (only where structurally needed)
- Consistent font (typically Calibri or Arial 11pt)

**Never include:**
- Borders around every cell
- Multiple fonts or font sizes
- Charts unless specifically requested
- Excessive formatting or decoration

## STEP-BY-STEP WORKFLOW

### Phase 1: Document Processing and Data Extraction

**Step 1.1: Analyze source data**
- Access source materials: uploaded documents, web search for public filings, or MCP server data
- Review data structure and identify key sections
- Locate financial statements (typically 3-5 years historical)
- Identify management projections if included
- Note fiscal year end date
- Flag any data quality issues immediately

**Step 1.2: Extract financial statements**
- Locate historical income statement data
- Extract balance sheet snapshots (year-end or quarter-end)
- Find cash flow statement
- Extract management projections if available
- Note all page references for traceability

**Step 1.3: Extract operating metrics**
- Identify non-financial KPIs relevant to industry
- Capture unit economics data
- Extract customer/location/capacity data
- Document growth metrics and trends

**Step 1.4: Extract market and industry data**
- Competitive positioning information
- Market size and growth rates
- Industry benchmark data
- Peer comparison information

**Step 1.5: Note key context**
- Transaction structure and rationale
- Management team background
- Investment highlights from source materials
- Risk factors and considerations
- Any data gaps or inconsistencies

### Phase 2: Data Normalization and Standardization

**Step 2.1: Normalize accounting presentation**
- Ensure consistent line item names across all years
- Standardize revenue recognition treatment
- Identify and document one-time charges
- Create "Adjusted EBITDA" reconciliation if needed
- Note any accounting policy changes

**Step 2.2: Apply format detection logic**
For each data point, determine format based on full context:
- Read tab name, table title, column header, and row label
- Apply essential rules (see above)
- When uncertain, examine original source document
- Default to cleaner formatting (less is more)

**Step 2.3: Identify normalization adjustments**
Common adjustments to document:
- Restructuring charges (add back if truly non-recurring)
- Stock-based compensation (add back per industry standard)
- Acquisition-related costs (add back, specify amounts)
- Legal settlements or litigation costs (evaluate recurrence risk)
- Asset sales or impairments (exclude from operating results)
- Related party adjustments (normalize to market rates)
Note: Source citation format varies by data source (page numbers for documents, URLs for web sources, server references for MCP data)

**Step 2.4: Create adjustment schedule**
For every normalization:
- Document what was adjusted and why
- Cite source (document page number, URL, or data source reference)
- Quantify dollar impact by year
- Assess recurrence risk
- Show calculation from reported to adjusted figures

**Step 2.5: Verify data integrity**
- Confirm subtotals sum correctly using formulas
- Verify balance sheet balances
- Check cash flow ties to balance sheet changes
- Cross-check numbers across tabs for consistency
- Flag any discrepancies for investigation

### Phase 3: Build Excel Workbook

**CRITICAL: Use xlsx skill for all Excel file manipulation. Read xlsx skill documentation before proceeding.**

**Step 3.1: Create standardized tab structure**
Create workbook with tabs:
- Executive Summary
- Historical Financials
- Balance Sheet
- Cash Flow
- Operating Metrics
- Property Performance (if applicable)
- Market Analysis
- Investment Highlights

**Step 3.2: Build each tab with proper formatting**
Apply formatting rules systematically:
- Headers: Bold, left-aligned, 11pt font
- Financial data: Currency format $#,##0.0 for millions
- Operational data: Number format #,##0 (no $)
- Percentages: 0.0% format
- Years: Text format to prevent comma insertion
- Negatives: Use accounting format with parentheses
- Underlines: Single above subtotals, double below totals

**Step 3.3: Insert formulas for calculations**
- All subtotals and totals must be formula-based
- Link balance sheet to income statement where appropriate
- Link cash flow to both income statement and balance sheet
- Create cross-tab references for validation
- Avoid hardcoding any calculated values

<correct_patterns>

### Row Reference Tracking - Copy This Pattern

**Store row numbers when writing data, then reference them in formulas:**

```python
# ✅ CORRECT - Track row numbers as you write
revenue_row = row
write_data_row(ws, row, "Revenue", revenue_values)
row += 1

ebitda_row = row
write_data_row(ws, row, "EBITDA", ebitda_values)
row += 1

# Use stored row numbers in formulas
margin_row = row
for col in year_columns:
    cell = ws.cell(row=margin_row, column=col)
    cell.value = f"={get_column_letter(col)}{ebitda_row}/{get_column_letter(col)}{revenue_row}"
```

**For complex models, use a dictionary:**

```python
row_refs = {
    'revenue': 5,
    'cogs': 6,
    'gross_profit': 7,
    'ebitda': 12
}

# Later in formulas
margin_formula = f"=B{row_refs['ebitda']}/B{row_refs['revenue']}"
```

</correct_patterns>

<common_mistakes>

### WRONG: Hardcoded Row Offsets

**Don't use relative offsets - they break when table structure changes:**

```python
# ❌ WRONG - Fragile offset-based references
formula = f"=B{row-15}/B{row-19}"  # What is row-15? What is row-19?

# ❌ WRONG - Magic numbers
formula = f"=B{current_row-10}*C{current_row-20}"
```

**Why this fails:**
- Breaks silently when you add/remove rows
- Impossible to verify correctness by reading code
- Creates debugging nightmares in the delivered Excel file

</common_mistakes>

**Step 3.4: Apply professional presentation**
- Freeze top row and first column on each data tab
- Set appropriate column widths (typically 12-15 characters)
- Right-align all numeric data
- Left-align all text and headers
- Add single/double underlines per accounting standards
- Ensure clean, minimal appearance

### Phase 4: Scenario Building (if projections included)

**Management Case:**
Present company's projections as provided in source materials:
- Extract all management assumptions
- Document growth rates, margin expansion, capital requirements
- Note key drivers and sensitivities
- Flag any "hockey stick" inflections that require skepticism
- Present as "Management Case" with clear labeling

**Base Case (Risk-Adjusted):**
Apply conservative adjustments to management projections based on company-specific risk factors:
- Apply revenue growth haircut reflecting execution risk and historical forecast accuracy
- Moderate margin expansion assumptions based on industry benchmarks and operating leverage
- Increase capex assumptions if growth-dependent
- Add working capital requirements if understated
- Delay synergy realization if applicable, based on integration complexity
- Document all adjustments with rationale and supporting analysis

**Downside Case (optional but recommended for LBO analysis):**
Stress test scenario based on industry cyclicality and company vulnerabilities:
- Model revenue decline reflecting recession risk or competitive pressure
- Assume margin compression under stress (volume deleverage, pricing pressure)
- Test covenant compliance and liquidity
- Assess downside protection
- Document key risks being stress-tested

**Documentation requirements for scenarios:**
Create assumptions schedule showing:
- Key assumptions by scenario (revenue growth, margins, capex %)
- Rationale for each adjustment
- Sensitivity analysis on key variables
- Historical forecast accuracy if available
- Comparison to industry benchmarks

### Phase 5: Quality Control and Validation

**Step 5.1: Data accuracy checks**
Validate:
- Every number traces to source (check spot samples, cite documents/URLs/servers)
- All calculations are formula-based (no hardcoded values)
- Subtotals and totals are mathematically correct
- Years display without commas (2024 NOT 2,024)
- No formula errors: #REF!, #VALUE!, #DIV/0!, #N/A

**Step 5.2: Format consistency checks**
Verify:
- Financial data has $ signs in format
- Operational data has NO $ signs
- Percentages display as % (15.0% not 0.15)
- Negative numbers use parentheses for financial data
- Headers are bold and left-aligned
- Numbers are right-aligned
- Years are text format

**Step 5.3: Structure and completeness checks**
Confirm:
- All required tabs present and properly sequenced
- Executive summary is concise (fits on one page)
- All key metrics captured comprehensively
- Logical flow from summary to detail
- Appropriate level of granularity in each tab
- No missing data or incomplete sections

**Step 5.4: Professional presentation checks**
Review:
- Minimal borders (only for structure)
- Consistent indentation (2 spaces for sub-items)
- Proper accounting underlines (single and double)
- Clean, professional appearance throughout
- Appropriate column widths (not too narrow or wide)

**Step 5.5: Documentation and assumptions checks**
Ensure:
- All normalization adjustments documented with rationale
- Source citations included (document page numbers, URLs, or data source references)
- Assumptions clearly stated and reasonable
- Executive summary accurate and impactful
- Filename includes company name and date

### Phase 6: Final Delivery

**Step 6.1: Create executive summary**
Write concise, impactful summary including:
- Company overview: business model, products/services, geography (2-3 sentences)
- Key financial metrics: Revenue, EBITDA, Growth rates (table format)
- Investment highlights: 3-5 key strengths or opportunities
- Notable risks or considerations (briefly)
- Transaction context if applicable

**Step 6.2: Final file preparation**
- Save workbook with proper naming: CompanyName_DataPack_YYYY-MM-DD.xlsx

## NORMALIZATION PATTERNS

### Common Adjustments to EBITDA

**1. Restructuring charges**
- Add back if truly non-recurring (facility closure, one-time severance)
- Do NOT add back if company restructures every year
- Document specific nature and rationale for non-recurrence
- Example: "2023 restructuring: $3.0M facility closure, documented in source materials, one-time event"

**2. Stock-based compensation**
- Industry standard: add back for private equity analysis
- Treat as non-cash operating expense
- Be consistent across all periods
- Note if unusually high or includes one-time grants

**3. Acquisition-related costs**
- Add back transaction fees, integration costs
- Document specific amounts by type
- Do not add back ongoing integration investments
- Cite source for each adjustment

**4. Legal settlements and litigation**
- Add back if truly isolated incident
- Assess recurrence risk (one settlement vs pattern of litigation)
- Document nature of settlement
- Consider if this is normal course of business

**5. Asset sales or impairments**
- Exclude gains/losses on asset sales from operating EBITDA
- Remove impairment charges if truly non-recurring
- Document what assets were sold/impaired and why
- Adjust revenue if assets generated operating income

**6. Related party adjustments**
- Normalize above-market related party expenses (rent, management fees)
- Adjust to market rates with supporting documentation
- Remove personal expenses run through business
- Document market rate comparison

### Conservative vs Aggressive Normalization

**Management Case:**
- Include all adjustments management proposes
- Accept company's definition of "non-recurring"
- More aggressive EBITDA adjustments
- Use for understanding management's view

**Base Case (Recommended for investment decisions):**
- Only clearly non-recurring items
- Apply higher scrutiny to recurring "one-time" charges
- Exclude speculative adjustments
- More conservative, defensible to investment committee
