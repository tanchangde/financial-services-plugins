# Teaser

description: Draft anonymous one-page company teasers for sell-side M&A processes. Creates a compelling summary without revealing the company's identity, designed to gauge buyer interest before NDA execution. Triggers on "teaser", "blind teaser", "anonymous profile", "one-pager for process", or "draft teaser for sell-side".

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather Inputs

- Company description (what they do, how they make money)
- Sector / industry
- Key financial metrics: revenue, EBITDA, growth rate, margins
- Geographic footprint
- Key selling points (3-5 highlights)
- What to anonymize vs. disclose
- Target buyer audience (strategic, financial, or both)

### Step 2: Teaser Structure

One page, professionally formatted:

**Header**
- Deal code name (e.g., "Project [Name]")
- Sector descriptor (e.g., "Leading Specialty Industrial Services Platform")
- "Confidential — For Discussion Purposes Only"

**Company Description** (2-3 sentences)
- What the company does, without naming it
- Market position (e.g., "a leading provider of...", "a top-3 player in...")
- Geography (region-level, not city-specific)

**Investment Highlights** (4-6 bullet points)
- Market leadership / positioning
- Revenue quality (recurring %, retention, diversification)
- Growth profile and trajectory
- Margin profile and expansion opportunity
- Management team strength
- Strategic value / synergy potential

**Financial Summary** (table or key metrics)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Revenue | $XXM |
| Revenue Growth | XX% CAGR |
| EBITDA | $XXM |
| EBITDA Margin | XX% |
| Employees | XXX |

**Transaction Overview** (2-3 sentences)
- What's being offered (100% sale, majority stake, growth equity)
- Indicative timeline
- Contact information for expressions of interest

### Step 3: Anonymization Check

Ensure the teaser doesn't inadvertently identify the company:
- No company name, brand names, or product names
- No specific city (use region: "Southeast US", "Midwest")
- No named customers or partners
- No employee count if it's too distinctive
- Revenue ranges instead of exact figures if the sector is small
- No logos, screenshots, or identifiable imagery

### Step 4: Output

- Word document (.docx) — one page, clean formatting
- PDF version for distribution
- Optional PowerPoint version (single slide)

## Important Notes

- The teaser's job is to generate interest, not close a deal — keep it tight and compelling
- Less is more — a good teaser makes buyers want to sign the NDA to learn more
- Use aspirational but accurate language — "leading", "differentiated", "high-growth" are fine if true
- Include enough financial detail to qualify serious buyers but not so much that tire-kickers waste your time
- Always have the client and legal review before distribution
- Track who receives the teaser — it becomes the outreach log for the process
