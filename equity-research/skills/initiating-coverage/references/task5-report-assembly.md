## 🔥 CRITICAL INSTRUCTION: SPARE NO TOKENS OR EFFORT

**THIS IS THE FINAL DELIVERABLE. GO ALL OUT. NO SHORTCUTS. NO ABBREVIATIONS.**

After completing 4 previous tasks, this final task assembles everything into publication-ready institutional research. **This must be PERFECT.**

### Absolute Requirements

**DO:**
- ✅ **Use ENTIRE token budget if needed** - This is what it's for
- ✅ **Write EVERY section in FULL** - Not summaries, not placeholders, FULL CONTENT
- ✅ **Include ALL 25-35 charts** - Embed every single chart from Task 4 throughout the document
- ✅ **Create ALL 12-20 tables** - Extract every financial table from Excel, don't skip any
- ✅ **Copy ALL 6-8K words from Task 1** - Use Company 101 content verbatim (40-50% of report)
- ✅ **Write 2,000-3,000 words on Projection Assumptions** - Product-by-product, region-by-region detail
- ✅ **Write 1,500-2,000 words on Scenario Analysis** - Specific Bull/Base/Bear parameters
- ✅ **Achieve 10,000-15,000 total words** - This is a MINIMUM, not a suggestion
- ✅ **Produce 30-50 pages minimum** - Text-dense with charts every 200-300 words
- ✅ **Professional institutional quality** - Indistinguishable from JPMorgan/Goldman Sachs

**NEVER:**
- ❌ "This section would include..." - WRITE THE ACTUAL SECTION
- ❌ "Charts would be inserted here..." - INSERT THE ACTUAL CHARTS
- ❌ "See financial model for details..." - EXTRACT AND WRITE THE DETAILS
- ❌ "For brevity, we'll summarize..." - NO SUMMARIZING, WRITE IN FULL
- ❌ Skip sections to conserve tokens - USE WHATEVER TOKENS ARE NEEDED
- ❌ Create abbreviated versions - EVERY SECTION MUST BE COMPLETE
- ❌ Reference external files instead of including content - INCLUDE EVERYTHING

## Report Assembly Philosophy

**CRITICAL PRINCIPLE 1**: A good equity research report is **text-dense with lots of illustrating images**.

**Target density**: 60-80% page coverage
- Every page should have BOTH text AND visuals
- Charts should be interspersed throughout text, not grouped
- Average 1 chart per page minimum (30-50 pages = 25-35+ charts)
- Tables should break up large text blocks

**CRITICAL PRINCIPLE 2**: Use Claude's DOCX and XLSX skills to programmatically create the report.

**REQUIRED TOOLS** (Claude has built-in skills for these):
- **DOCX skill** - To create and manipulate Word documents
  - Read Task 1 .md file → Convert to Word formatting
  - Insert images from Task 4 chart files
  - Create tables
  - Format text, headers, footers, page numbers
  - Add hyperlinks
- **XLSX skill** - To read data from Excel files
  - Extract tables from Task 2 financial model
  - Read Task 3 valuation tabs
  - Pull historical financials from Task 1
- **Direct file operations** - Work with actual files
  - Read: `[Company]_Research_Document_[Date].md`
  - Read: `[Company]_Financial_Model_[Date].xlsx`
  - Read: `chart_01.png`, `chart_02.png`, etc.
  - Write: `[Company]_Initiation_Report_[Date].docx`

**DO NOT**: Manually copy/paste or describe what should be done
**DO**: Use Claude's DOCX and XLSX skills to open files, extract data, and create the DOCX report

**Content Reuse Strategy**:
- **Task 1 content (40-50% of report)**: Read .md file → Convert to Word format → Add charts
- **Task 2/3 data (30-40% of report)**: Read .xlsx file → Extract tables → Write interpretation
- **Original writing (10-20% of report)**: Investment thesis, projection assumptions, scenario analysis

**This approach**:
- Maximizes efficiency (no rewriting 6-8K words that are already good)
- Maintains quality (Task 1 content is substantive, professional analysis)
- Focuses effort on value-add (quantitative interpretation and investment thesis)
- Uses actual files programmatically (not manual work)

---

## Step-by-Step Report Assembly Workflow

### Step 1: Organize All Inputs and Verify Files

**Verify all input files exist:**

Use Claude's file operations to check:
- `[Company]_Research_Document_[Date].md` (Task 1)
- `[Company]_Historical_Financials_[Date].xlsx` (Task 1)
- `[Company]_Financial_Model_[Date].xlsx` (Task 2 with Task 3 tabs)
- `[Company]_Valuation_Analysis_[Date].md` (Task 3)
- `[Company]_Charts_[Date].zip` (Task 4) - **Extract this first**

**Step 1a: Extract Charts from Zip File**

Before proceeding, extract all chart files from the Task 4 zip:
- Locate `[Company]_Charts_[Date].zip`
- Extract all contents to a working directory (e.g., `task4_charts/`)
- Verify 25-35 PNG files were extracted
- Verify chart_index.txt is present

**Expected folder structure after extraction:**
```
[Company]_Report_Working/
├── [Company]_Research_Document_[Date].md
├── [Company]_Historical_Financials_[Date].xlsx
├── [Company]_Financial_Model_[Date].xlsx (includes Task 3 valuation tabs)
│   ├── [Task 2 tabs: Revenue Model, Income Statement, Scenarios, etc.]
│   └── [Task 3 tabs: DCF, Sensitivity, Comps, Valuation Summary]
├── [Company]_Valuation_Analysis_[Date].md
├── [Company]_Charts_[Date].zip
├── task4_charts/ (extracted from zip)
│   ├── chart_01_stock_price.png
│   ├── chart_02_revenue_growth.png
│   ├── chart_03_revenue_by_product.png ⭐
│   ├── chart_04_revenue_by_geography.png ⭐
│   ├── ... (21-31 more charts)
│   ├── chart_28_dcf_sensitivity.png ⭐
│   ├── chart_32_valuation_football_field.png ⭐
│   └── chart_index.txt
└── sources_and_urls.txt
```

**Open and inspect files using Claude skills:**

1. **Read Task 1 markdown file** - Use Read tool to view content
2. **Open Task 2/3 Excel file** - Use XLSX skill to inspect tabs:
   - Verify required tabs exist: Revenue Model, Income Statement, Scenarios, DCF, Sensitivity Analysis, Comparable Companies
3. **Read Task 3 markdown file** - Use Read tool to view valuation analysis
4. **Check chart files** - Verify all 25-35 PNG files present

**Note**: Task 2's financial model file now contains both the original modeling tabs (from Task 2) AND the valuation tabs (added by Task 3). This single Excel file contains all quantitative data needed for report assembly.

### Step 2: Extract Tables from Excel Using XLSX Skill

**Use Claude's XLSX skill to extract data from Excel files:**

#### Table 1: Page 1 Summary Financials

Use XLSX skill to:
1. Open `[Company]_Financial_Model_[Date].xlsx`

4. Extract 15-20 rows showing each geographic region
5. Include columns: Region, historical years, projected years, % of Total, YoY Growth

#### Table 5: Comparable Companies
**Extract from:** Task 3 valuation tabs in Task 2's financial model (`Comparable Companies` tab)

Use XLSX skill to:
1. Open `[Company]_Financial_Model_[Date].xlsx`
2. Read from `Comparable Companies` tab (added by Task 3)
3. Extract full table with company names as row headers
4. **CRITICAL**: Verify statistical summary rows are present at bottom:
   - Maximum
   - 75th Percentile
   - Median
   - 25th Percentile
   - Minimum
5. If statistical summary is missing, report ERROR

**Expected format:**
```
Company      Ticker  Mkt Cap  EV/Rev  EV/Rev  EV/EBITDA  EV/EBITDA  P/E   Rev     EBITDA
                     ($B)     LTM     NTM     LTM        NTM        NTM   Growth  Margin
[5-10 peers plus target, then statistical summary]
```

#### Additional Tables (7-15 more)
**Extract from Task 2 financial model (with Task 3 tabs):**

Use XLSX skill to extract these tables:

**DCF Assumptions Table** (Task 3 `DCF` tab)
- Open `[Company]_Financial_Model_[Date].xlsx`
- Read from DCF tab
- Extract columns A-C (Assumption, Value, Source)
- Extract first 20 rows

**DCF Sensitivity Matrix** (Task 3 `Sensitivity Analysis` tab)
- Read from Sensitivity Analysis tab

**Write in this order:**

#### A. Financial Analysis (1,200-1,800 words)
- Analyze historical performance from model
- Discuss trends in revenue, margins, cash flow
- Reference specific charts and tables
- Lead with numbers

#### B. Projection Assumptions (2,000-3,000 words) ⭐ CRITICAL

- Must be product-by-product (8-12 points per product)
- Must be region-by-region (6-8 points per region)
- Must include margin, opex, capex, working capital assumptions
- **This section separates amateur from professional analysis**

#### C. Scenario Analysis (1,500-2,000 words) ⭐ CRITICAL
- Follow detailed structure from Report Structure section above
- Bull case: specific parameters, catalysts, probability, valuation
- Base case: most likely scenario with rationale
- Bear case: downside triggers and parameters
- Comparison table and analysis
- **Must have specific quantified parameters for each scenario**

#### D. Growth Drivers (800-1,200 words)
- 3-5 key drivers with quantified opportunities
- Timeline and milestones
- Evidence from model

#### E. Valuation Methodology (800-1,200 words)

### Step 4: Write Synthesis Sections

**Write in this order:**

#### A. Investment Thesis (800-1,200 words)
- 3-5 key pillars
- Each pillar: 200-300 words
- Lead with key statistic
- Quantify financial impact
- Include timeline

#### B. Risk Assessment (600-900 words)
- Pull from Task 1 research document
- Organize into 4 categories
- 8-12 risks total
- Each risk: 50-100 words

#### C. Price Target & Recommendation (300-500 words)
- Final recommendation
- Price target with upside %
- Key catalysts with timeframes
- Key risks to target

#### D. Investment Summary (500-700 words) - WRITE LAST
- Page 1 content
- 3-4 detailed bullets with bold headers
- Complete synthesis of all findings
- **Write this section LAST after full analysis complete**

### Step 5: Integrate Company Content from Task 1

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION**: Use Task 1 research document almost verbatim. DO NOT rewrite.

**The company research from Task 1 (6-8K words) is already professional, substantive analysis. Objective:**
1. **Reformat for Word** - Convert markdown to DOCX formatting
2. **Insert charts inline** - Add relevant charts from Task 4 throughout the text
3. **Minor style adjustments** - Ensure consistent formatting with rest of report

**Extract these sections from Task 1 research document:**
- Company description (800-1,200 words) → **Use verbatim, insert company overview charts**
- Company history (800-1,200 words) → **Use verbatim, insert timeline chart**
- Management bios (1,000-1,400 words) → **Use verbatim, insert org chart if available**
- Products & services (700-1,000 words) → **Use verbatim, insert product portfolio charts**
- Customers & GTM (500-700 words) → **Use verbatim, insert customer segmentation charts**
- Industry overview (800-1,200 words) → **Use verbatim, insert market size evolution charts**
- Competitive landscape (700-1,000 words) → **Use verbatim, insert competitive positioning charts**
- TAM analysis (500-700 words) → **Use verbatim, insert TAM sizing charts**
- Risk assessment (600-900 words) → **Use verbatim, format as Investment Thesis & Risks section**

**Chart Integration Strategy:**
- Every 200-300 words of text → Insert 1 chart
- Company 101 section (pages 6-17) should have 8-12 charts interspersed
- Place charts immediately after the paragraph that discusses the topic
- **Result**: Dense, visually rich pages (60-80% coverage)

### Step 6: Assemble DOCX Report

**CRITICAL**: Create actual DOCX file, NOT markdown.

**Assembly Order (Most Efficient):**

#### Phase A: Create Structure & Add Page 1
1. Create DOCX document
2. Set up professional styling (fonts, headers, footers)

```
Good page layout example:
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│ Section Header              │
│ Text paragraph (200 words)  │
│ [Chart embedded]            │
│ Text paragraph (200 words)  │
│ [Table embedded]            │
│ Text paragraph (200 words)  │
│ [Chart embedded]            │
└─────────────────────────────┘

BAD - Avoid:
- Full page with only one chart
- Multiple pages of pure text
- Charts grouped at end of sections
```

**Result**: 30-50 page report that is text-dense with illustrating images throughout

## File Operations Summary

**Throughout the entire assembly process, use Claude's DOCX and XLSX skills with actual file operations:**

**Reading Input Files:**
- ✓ Use Read tool: `[Company]_Research_Document_[Date].md` - Read Task 1 research
- ✓ Use XLSX skill: Open `[Company]_Financial_Model_[Date].xlsx` and read tabs - Extract tables from Task 2/3
- ✓ Use Read tool: `[Company]_Valuation_Analysis_[Date].md` - Read Task 3 analysis
- ✓ Use DOCX skill: Insert images from `task4_charts/chart_XX.png` files

**Writing Output File:**
- ✓ Use DOCX skill: Create new Word document
- ✓ Use DOCX skill: Add paragraphs (text from input .md files)
- ✓ Use DOCX skill: Create tables (data from Excel files read via XLSX skill)
- ✓ Use DOCX skill: Insert images (chart .png files)
- ✓ Use DOCX skill: Save final file as `[Company]_Initiation_Report_[Date].docx`

**Do NOT manually copy/paste. Use Claude's built-in skills to:**
1. Read from .md files (Task 1, Task 3) using Read tool
2. Read from .xlsx files (Task 2 with Task 3 tabs) using XLSX skill
3. Read from .png files (Task 4) as image files
4. Write to .docx file (Task 5 output) using DOCX skill

This approach is efficient, reproducible, and ensures all data flows correctly from source files to final report.

## Writing Style Guidelines

### Lead with Numbers (CRITICAL)

✓ **CORRECT**: "Revenue increased 150% YoY to $250M in Q4 2024, driven by..."
✗ **INCORRECT**: "The company saw strong revenue growth this quarter..."

✓ **CORRECT**: "EBITDA margin expanded 500bps to 30% vs. 25% in FY2023"
✗ **INCORRECT**: "EBITDA margin expanded versus the prior year"

✓ **CORRECT**: "Market share increased 3 percentage points to 18% vs. 15% in 2023"
✗ **INCORRECT**: "Market share increased compared to last year"

✓ **CORRECT**: "Management expects 40-50% revenue growth in FY2025E"
✗ **INCORRECT**: "Management expects strong revenue growth"

### Professional Writing Standards

- **Front-load**: Most important information first
- **Data-driven**: Lead with numbers and metrics
- **Specific**: Concrete examples, not generic statements
- **Objective**: Present facts, acknowledge risks
- **Confident**: State views clearly with supporting evidence
- **Active voice**: "We estimate revenue will reach $500M"
- **Precise**: Avoid "might", "could", "possibly"

### Number Formatting

**Consistency:**
- Billions: $X.XB (e.g., "$2.5B")
- Millions: $XXXM (e.g., "$250M")
- Always specify: YoY, QoQ, CAGR
- Basis points for small margin changes: "500bps"
- Year format: "2024A" (actual), "2025E" (estimate)

### Use "vs." not "versus"
✓ **CORRECT**: "Gross margin of 65% vs. 60% in prior year"
✗ **INCORRECT**: "Gross margin of 65% versus 60%"

---

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

**⚠️ MOST COMMON MISTAKE: TAKING SHORTCUTS DUE TO LENGTH**

Many reports fail because they use placeholders like "details would be included here" or "see model for data" instead of actually writing/extracting the content. **DO NOT DO THIS.** Write every section in full. Extract every table. Embed every chart. Use whatever tokens are needed.

1. **Rewriting Task 1 content**: DO NOT rewrite the 6-8K words from Task 1. Use almost verbatim - just reformat and add charts. Focus writing effort on quantitative sections (projections, scenarios, valuation).
2. **Sparse pages**: Every page must have BOTH text AND visuals. Target 60-80% page density. Insert charts every 200-300 words.
3. **Grouping charts at end**: Charts must be interspersed throughout text, not grouped. Place chart immediately after paragraph discussing that topic.
4. **Writing in markdown**: Use DOCX format, NOT markdown
5. **Skipping Page 1 format**: Must follow exact institutional format
6. **Generic bullets**: Page 1 bullets need bold headers + specific data
7. **Short sections**: Must meet minimum word counts
8. **Thin assumptions**: Projection Assumptions MUST be 2,000-3,000 words with product-by-product and region-by-region detail
9. **Vague scenarios**: Must have specific parameters for Bull/Base/Bear
10. **Plain text URLs**: All citations must be clickable hyperlinks
11. **Missing statistical summary**: Comps table must have max/75th/median/25th/min
12. **Charts not embedded**: All 25-35 charts must be IN document, not just referenced
13. **Numbers don't match model**: Verify all figures against source
14. **Skipping verification**: Quality check is NOT optional

---
