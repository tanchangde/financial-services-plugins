# Equity Research Initiation Report Template

This template provides the structure for creating a comprehensive equity research initiation report. Use this as a guide when constructing the final report document.

**NOTE:** The actual report MUST be created using the DOCX skill. DO NOT generate markdown content.

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**
1. **Generate 20-30+ chart images** using Python (matplotlib/plotly) BEFORE creating the Word document
2. **Use DOCX skill**: Create professional report with proper styles, headers/footers, and formatting
3. **Embed actual chart images**: Insert the generated PNG/JPG chart files into the Word document at appropriate locations
4. **NO MARKDOWN**: Do not generate markdown content. Use DOCX skill to create a .docx file.

**CRITICAL FORMATTING GUIDANCE:**
- **MAXIMUM DENSITY**: Every page should be packed with information. Intersperse text, charts, and tables throughout.
- **NO ORPHANED SECTIONS**: Never have a section header alone or a single chart on its own page.
- **20-30+ ACTUAL CHART IMAGES**: Generate charts as image files, then embed within text sections using DOCX skill.

## PAGE 1: INVESTMENT UPDATE (MOST IMPORTANT PAGE)

**CRITICAL**: Page 1 is NOT a traditional executive summary. It is an **Investment Update** with a specific institutional format used by professional equity research firms.

**IMPORTANT STRUCTURAL NOTES:**
- This is an "Investment Update" or "Company Update" page, not "Executive Summary"
- Uses a rating box in top left corner
- Features stock price performance chart (Figure 1) prominently
- Contains 3-4 detailed bullet points with ■ character
- Each bullet has **bold topic header** followed by 3-5 sentence explanation
- Bottom section has financial and valuation metrics table
- All charts must have figure numbers (Figure 1, Figure 2, etc.) with source lines

### Layout Structure

**TOP LEFT - RATING BOX:**
```
Rating:             [OUTPERFORM / NEUTRAL / UNDERWEIGHT / etc.]
Price ([Date]):     $[XX.XX]
Target Price:       $[XX.XX]
52-Week Range:      $[XX.XX] - $[XX.XX]
Market Cap:         $[XX.X]B
Enterprise Value:   $[XX.X]B
```

```

**MAIN CONTENT - GRAY HEADER BAR:**
```
[OUTPERFORM / NEUTRAL / etc.] RECOMMENDATION / COMPANY UPDATE
```

**MAIN CONTENT - DETAILED BULLETS (3-4 bullets):**

Use ■ character for bullets. Each bullet follows this format:
```
■ **[Bold Topic Header capturing main point].** Regular text explanation providing 3-5 sentences of detail with specific numbers, comparisons, and analysis. Lead with numbers and quantification where possible. Use "vs." not "versus". Be specific and concrete.

■ **[Second Topic Header].** [3-5 sentences of detailed explanation...]

■ **[Third Topic Header].** [3-5 sentences of detailed explanation...]

■ **[Fourth Topic Header - Optional].** [3-5 sentences of detailed explanation...]
```

**EXAMPLE BULLET FORMAT:**
```
■ **Constitutional safety and enterprise focus should enable $635bn+ TAM by 2030.**
Safety-first model development ethos, strong coding capabilities and distribution partnerships
have aided Anthropic's enterprise market adoption. With the AI market expected to reach $635bn+
by 2030, Anthropic is well-positioned to capture share given its focus on safety and enterprise
use cases. Management has indicated that 60% of current revenue comes from enterprise customers,
suggesting strong product-market fit in high-value segments.

## FIGURE NUMBERING AND FORMATTING STANDARDS

**CRITICAL**: All charts, graphs, and tables must follow strict figure numbering conventions used in professional equity research.

### Figure Numbering Format

**Every chart/table must have:**
1. **Sequential numbering**: Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, etc. (continue sequentially throughout entire report)
2. **Descriptive title**: "Figure X - [Company] [Specific Metric] [Type of Chart/Analysis]"
3. **Source line** (always at bottom): "Source: Company data, [Firm Name] estimates."

**Examples:**
- Figure 1 - [Company] Stock Price Performance
- Figure 2 - [Company] Historical and Projected Revenue Mix by Product
- Figure 3 - [Company] Revenue by Geographic Region
- Figure 4 - [Product Name] Revenue and Price per Patient per Year
- Figure 5 - [Company] Gross Margin Evolution
- Figure 6 - DCF Sensitivity Analysis ($/share)
- Figure 7 - Valuation Football Field

### Caption Format

```
Figure X - [Descriptive Title]
[Chart/Table/Graph content]
Source: Company data, [Firm Name] estimates.
```

For tables with multiple data sources:
```
Figure X - [Descriptive Title]
[Table content]
Source: Company filings, FactSet, [Firm Name] estimates.
```

### Placement Guidelines

- Figures should be numbered in order of appearance in the report
- First figure (Figure 1) is typically the stock price chart or revenue growth trajectory on Page 1
- Each figure must have its caption directly below the visual
- Source line should be in smaller font, italicized, at the very bottom of the figure

## NOTES ON USING THIS TEMPLATE

1. **PAGE 1 IS CRITICAL:** The executive summary on page 1 must contain ALL key information - fast facts, financial snapshot, 3 charts, valuation summary, thesis, and risks. This is the most important page.

2. **MAXIMUM DENSITY:** Professional equity research is EXTREMELY information-dense. Every page should be packed with interspersed text, charts, and tables. Aim for 60-80% page coverage with minimal white space.

3. **NO ORPHANED SECTIONS:** Never have a section header alone, or a single chart/table on its own page. Always combine elements. Example: DON'T put "Financial Snapshot" on page 6 by itself - integrate it with surrounding content.

4. **20-30+ CHARTS:** Include extensive graphics throughout, with specific emphasis on:
   - **Revenue by product/segment** (stacked area chart)
   - **Revenue by geography** (stacked bar chart)
   - **Financial performance trends** (multiple charts)
   - Charts should be embedded within text, not grouped separately

5. **Use DOC Skill:** This outline should be converted to a professional Word document using the DOC skill, with proper formatting, styles, headers/footers, and page numbers

6. **Intersplice Content:** Text paragraphs should have charts embedded inline. Each page should have 2-4 distinct elements (tables, charts, text blocks).

7. **Consistent Formatting:** Use consistent styles for headers, body text, tables, and charts throughout. Pick a color scheme and stick to it.

8. **References:** Include citations and sources for all data points

9. **Proofread:** Always proofread for accuracy, especially financial data and calculations

10. **Executive Summary Last:** While it appears on page 1, write this section last after completing the full analysis

11. **Balance:** Present both positive and negative aspects objectively

12. **Specific > Generic:** Use specific data and examples rather than generic statements
