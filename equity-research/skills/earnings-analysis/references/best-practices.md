# Best Practices, Examples, and Quality Guidelines

This document provides examples, tips for success, common mistakes to avoid, and comprehensive quality checklists.

## Example Headlines

### Good Earnings Update Headlines:
- "Nike Q2 FY24: DTC Strength Offsets Wholesale Weakness - Maintaining OW, PT $95"
- "Tesla Q3'24: Cybertruck Ramp Ahead of Plan - Raising Estimates, PT to $285"
- "LVMH Q4'24: Fashion & Leather Resilient, Wines Weak - In-Line, Reiterating Buy"
- "Apple Q1 FY24: Services Beat, iPhone Miss - Mixed Quarter, Lowering PT to $185"

### Bad Headlines (Avoid):
- "Nike Quarterly Update" (too generic, no takeaway)
- "Company Reports Earnings" (states obvious, no analysis)
- "Q3 Results Analysis" (no company name, no view)

## Tips for Success

1. **Speed matters**: Published 24-48hrs post-earnings, not days later

2. **Lead with conclusion**: Beat or miss? Up or down estimates?

3. **Quantify everything**: "Strong" means nothing, "$150M beat on $1.2B revenue" is clear

4. **Focus on drivers**: Don't just say "revenue beat", explain WHY

5. **Show the work**: Old estimates → New estimates with reasons

6. **Update price target if material**: If estimates change >5%, usually PT changes too

7. **Acknowledge the call**: Reference management commentary, don't just analyze the press release

8. **Compare to peers**: If similar companies reported, note relative performance

9. **Be concise**: This is NOT a comprehensive report, stay focused on quarterly results

10. **Chart the trends**: Quarterly progression charts are most valuable

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Too comprehensive**: Don't write an initiation-length report for quarterly results

❌ **Missing beat/miss**: Lead with whether results beat or missed expectations

❌ **Not updating estimates**: Must provide updated forward estimates

❌ **Vague language**: "Strong performance" without quantification

❌ **Ignoring guidance**: If company guides, analyze it thoroughly

❌ **Too slow**: Publishing 5+ days after earnings loses relevance

❌ **Rehashing basics**: Don't spend 3 pages explaining what the company does

❌ **Missing price target update**: If estimates changed materially, PT should too

❌ **No investment impact**: Must connect results to thesis and rating

❌ **Missing citations**: Every number needs a source with clickable hyperlinks

❌ **Plain text URLs**: All URLs must be formatted as clickable hyperlinks
