# Investment Proposal

description: Create professional investment proposals for prospective clients. Covers the firm's approach, proposed allocation, expected outcomes, and fee structure. Use when pitching new clients or presenting a new investment strategy. Triggers on "investment proposal", "prospect presentation", "pitch new client", "proposal for [client]", or "new client presentation".

## Workflow

### Step 1: Prospect Context

Gather:
- **Prospect name** and household details
- **Current situation**: Existing advisor? Self-directed? What prompted the meeting?
- **Assets**: Estimated AUM, account types, current holdings (if shared)
- **Goals**: Retirement, wealth preservation, growth, income, education, estate
- **Risk tolerance**: Conservative, moderate, aggressive (or questionnaire score)
- **Constraints**: ESG preferences, concentrated stock, illiquidity needs
- **Fee sensitivity**: What are they paying now?
- **Competition**: Who else are they considering?

### Step 2: Proposal Structure

**I. About Our Firm** (1 page)
- Firm overview, history, AUM
- Investment philosophy (in plain English)
- Team bios (relevant to this client)
- Client service model (how often do we meet, who do they call)

**II. Understanding Your Needs** (1 page)
- Restate their goals and concerns — show you listened
- Key planning considerations identified in discovery
- What success looks like for them

**III. Proposed Investment Strategy** (2-3 pages)
- Recommended asset allocation with rationale
- How allocation maps to their goals and risk tolerance
- Investment vehicles (ETFs, mutual funds, individual securities, alternatives)
- Tax-aware strategy (asset location, tax-loss harvesting)

Proposed allocation:

| Asset Class | Allocation | Vehicle | Rationale |
|------------|-----------|---------|-----------|
| | | | |

**IV. Expected Outcomes** (1-2 pages)
- Projected growth scenarios (conservative, moderate, optimistic)
- Monte Carlo probability of meeting goals
- Income projections (if retirement or income-focused)
- Risk metrics (max drawdown, volatility)
- Comparison to current portfolio (if known)

**V. Fee Structure** (1 page)
- Advisory fee schedule (tiered if applicable)
- Underlying fund expenses
- Total all-in cost estimate
- How fees compare to industry averages
- Value proposition — what they get for the fee

**VI. Getting Started** (1 page)
- Account opening process
- Asset transfer timeline
- Transition plan (if moving from another advisor)
- First 90 days — what to expect
- Required documents and next steps

### Step 3: Customization

- Match the tone to the prospect (corporate executive vs. small business owner vs. retiree)
- If they have a concentrated stock position, address it directly
- If they're comparing you to robo-advisors, emphasize the planning and relationship value
- If they're price-sensitive, lead with total value and outcomes, not just fees

### Step 4: Output

- PowerPoint presentation (12-15 slides) with firm branding
- PDF leave-behind version
- One-page summary for follow-up email

## Important Notes

- The proposal should feel personalized, not templated — reference their specific situation
- Don't oversell performance — set realistic expectations and emphasize process
- Always include disclaimers (projections are hypothetical, past performance, etc.)
- The transition plan matters — clients fear the disruption of switching advisors
- Follow up within 48 hours with the proposal and a clear next step
- Compliance must review before presenting to prospects
