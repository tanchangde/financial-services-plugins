### Step 5: Market Commentary

Brief market summary tailored to the client's level of sophistication:
- What happened in markets this quarter (2-3 sentences)
- How it affected the portfolio
- Outlook and positioning rationale (2-3 sentences)
- No jargon for retail clients; can be more technical for sophisticated investors

### Step 6: Activity Summary

- Contributions and withdrawals
- Dividends and interest received
- Fees charged
- Rebalancing activity

### Step 7: Planning Notes

- Progress toward financial goals (retirement, education, etc.)
- Any plan changes or recommendations
- Upcoming action items
- Next review date

### Step 8: Output

- PDF report (8-12 pages) with firm branding
- Word document for customization
- Excel data appendix (optional)

**Report Structure:**
1. Cover page (client name, period, firm logo)
2. Executive summary (1 page)
3. Performance summary (1-2 pages)
4. Allocation overview with charts (1 page)
5. Holdings detail (1-2 pages)
6. Market commentary (1 page)
7. Activity summary (1 page)
8. Planning notes (1 page)
9. Disclosures and disclaimers (1 page)

## Important Notes

- Performance must be calculated net of fees unless client/compliance requires gross
- Always include appropriate disclaimers and disclosures (past performance, risk factors)
- Reports should be consistent across clients — use a standard template
- Match the level of detail to the client — some want every holding, others want a one-page summary
- Benchmark selection matters — use the benchmark from the IPS, not whatever looks best
- Review for compliance approval before first distribution of a new template
