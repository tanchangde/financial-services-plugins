## CRITICAL STANDARDS - APPLY TO EVERY ANALYSIS

### Source File Primacy

When source files (Excel/CSV) are provided:
* **Extract values DIRECTLY** — Do not perform your own calculations; use the numbers as they appear
* **Maintain consistency** — When the same metric appears in multiple places, ensure identical values throughout
* **Verify calculations** — If the prompt asks you to calculate something, verify your result matches related data in the source
* **Round only as shown** — Use the same decimal precision as the source file

### Prompt Fidelity

When the prompt specifies exact requirements, follow them verbatim:

**Slide Titles & Section Names:**
* If prompt says `"Overview and Competitive Scope" slide` — use EXACTLY that title, not a paraphrase
* If prompt says `within the "Segment Mix" section` — use EXACTLY "Segment Mix" as the section header
* Never substitute with creative alternatives (e.g., don't use "FY2024 Segment Contribution Analysis" when "Overview and Competitive Scope" was specified)

**Chart vs Table:**
* If prompt says `embedded chart` — create an actual PowerPoint chart object, NOT a table
* If prompt says `data labels must display` — these go on chart elements (bars, slices, lines), not table cells
* Tables and charts are NOT interchangeable — use exactly what's specified

**Complete Data Series:**
* If prompt lists 7 competitors, include ALL 7 — not 5 or 6
* If prompt shows data for years 2015-2025, include ALL years — not a subset
* If prompt specifies 6 series in a chart (Uber, Lyft, DiDi, Bolt, Grab, Gojek), include ALL 6 — not 4

**Exact Values & Phrasing:**
* If prompt says `Revenue: $43.98B (+18% YoY)` — display exactly that format
* If prompt says `surpasses DoorDash 4:1, Lyft 8:1` — use those exact ratios, not "7.6x Lyft"
* If prompt gives specific percentages (e.g., "Uber 30%, DiDi 35%"), use exactly those numbers

**When in doubt:** Re-read the prompt. If it specifies something explicitly, that's not a suggestion — it's a requirement.

### Reference Files

This skill includes reference files in the `references/` folder. Use them as follows:
* **`references/schemas.md`** — Table templates for M&A transactions, scenario analysis, and slide structure. Reference when building financial tables or investment scenarios.
* **`references/frameworks.md`** — 2x2 matrix axis pairs by industry. Reference when choosing positioning visualization dimensions.

### Source Quality Hierarchy

When sources conflict, prioritize in this order:
1. **10-Ks / Annual Reports** — Audited, highest reliability
2. **Earnings Calls / Investor Presentations** — Management commentary, forward guidance
3. **Sell-Side Research** — Analyst estimates, useful for private company sizing
4. **Industry Reports** (McKinsey, Gartner, etc.) — Market sizing, trends
5. **News Articles** — Use only for recent developments, verify against primary sources

### Data Comparability
* **Time periods must match** — All competitor metrics from same fiscal year. Flag exceptions: "(FY24)" vs "(H1 2024)"
* **Metric definitions must match** — Same calculation methodology across competitors
* **Currency normalization** — Convert all figures to USD for international comparisons; note exchange rate and date used
* **Use "-" for missing data** — Never leave cells blank; for private companies, use "N/A" or estimates with "[E]" flag
* **Cite every number** — Format: "[Company] [Document] ([Date])"
* **Source file fidelity** — When Excel/CSV files are provided, use values exactly as given; do not recalculate or round differently than shown

### Design & Formatting
* **Slide titles = insights** — "Scale leaders pulling away from niche players" not "Competitive Analysis"
* **Slide titles must fit** — One or two lines fine, but no overflow; reduce font size if needed (min 24pt)
* **Signposts = quantified** — "margin below 40%" not "margins decline"
* **Ratings include actuals** — "●●● $160B" not just "●●●"
* **Slide numbers required** — Every slide must have a page number

### Presentation-Specific Requirements
* **Actual embedded charts required** — Pie charts, bar charts, and line graphs must be real PowerPoint chart objects (created via pptx skill), NOT text/ASCII representations
* **Match prompt structure** — If prompt specifies slide structure, follow it
* **Competitor tables** — For comprehensive analysis: metrics table + qualitative table per competitor. For rapid assessments: single combined table is acceptable.
* **Segment financials** — Include both Revenue AND EBITDA when available. For private competitors or limited disclosure, revenue-only tables are acceptable; note "[EBITDA not disclosed]"

### Visual Reference

**Review `examples/Toast_Embedded_Payments_Competitive_Landscape_v3.pptx` and match its professional quality:**

**Spacing & Overflow Prevention:**
- **Title-to-content gap** — Minimum 0.4" between slide title bottom and first content element
- **Section header gaps** — Minimum 0.25" between section headers and content below
- **Element buffers** — Minimum 0.2" between any two elements (tables, text boxes, charts)
- **Margin safety** — Keep all content at least 0.5" from slide edges
- **Text overflow** — If text doesn't fit, reduce font size or split across slides; never let text clip or overlap

**Slide Titles:**
- **Must fit within slide width** — One or two lines is fine, but text must not overflow or clip
- **If title is too long** — Shorten wording or reduce font size (minimum 24pt)
- **Front-load the insight** — Put the key point first, details second

**Chart Formatting:**
- **Legend inside layout** — Always set `include_in_layout=True` so legends don't overlap chart area
- **Legend position** — Use RIGHT for pie charts (≤6 items), BOTTOM for line/bar charts (≤4 series)
- **Too many series** — If >6 series, consider splitting into multiple charts or using a table instead
- **Data labels** — For pie charts, show percentages on slices rather than relying solely on legend

**Typography (set explicitly, never use defaults):**
- Slide title: 28-32pt bold
- Section headers: 16-20pt bold
- Body text: 11-14pt regular
- Table text: 10-12pt regular
- Sources/footnotes: 8-10pt, gray
- **Consistency rule**: Same element type = same font size throughout deck

**Layout:**
- Clean grid alignment — tables and text blocks align to consistent margins
- Generous whitespace — don't crowd slides; let content breathe
- Visual hierarchy — most important insight is largest/most prominent
- One key message per slide — supporting detail below

**Color:**
- Limited palette — 2-3 colors max (one accent color for emphasis)
- Muted tones — avoid bright/saturated colors; use navy, gray, muted blue
- Consistent application — same color meanings throughout (e.g., accent for key metrics)

**Tables:**
- Light gray header row with bold text
- Alternating row shading (subtle) or clean white with thin borders
- Right-align numbers, left-align text
- Adequate cell padding — text shouldn't touch borders

**Rating visuals:**
- ●●● / ●●○ / ●○○ system with actual metric alongside
- Consistent placement in comparative tables

Adapt structure and metrics to fit your industry — but maintain this level of polish.

### What's STRICT vs FLEXIBLE

| STRICT (Every Time) | FLEXIBLE (Case-by-Case) |
|---------------------|------------------------|
| Exact titles/sections when prompt specifies | Creative titles when prompt doesn't specify |
| Chart when prompt says chart; table when prompt says table | Visualization type when prompt doesn't specify |
| All data points/competitors listed in prompt | Number of competitors when prompt doesn't specify |
| Exact values/ratios when prompt specifies them | Rounding when prompt doesn't specify precision |

## WORKFLOW PHASES

### Phase 1: Clarify Requirements
Before starting, confirm:
* **Scope**: Single company deep-dive or multi-company comparison?
* **Output**: Presentation or written memo?
* **Focus areas**: Specific competitors, dimensions, or strategic questions?
* **Investment context**: Need scenarios/signposts?
* **Source files**: What data files are provided and what values should be extracted?

### Phase 2: Research → Outline → Review → Create
**Do NOT create final output until outline is reviewed.**

The 10-step Analysis Workflow below (Steps 0-9) is executed during Phase 2. Complete research and outlining before creating final slides or documents.

## ANALYSIS WORKFLOW

### Step 0: Identify Industry-Defining Metrics
Before diving into analysis, identify 3-5 metrics that matter most for this industry:

| Industry | Key Metrics |
|----------|-------------|
| SaaS | ARR, NRR, CAC payback, LTV/CAC, Rule of 40 |
| Payments | GPV, take rate, attach rate, transaction margin |
| Marketplaces | GMV, take rate, buyer/seller ratio, repeat rate |
| Retail | Same-store sales, inventory turns, sales per sq ft |
| Logistics | Volume, cost per unit, on-time delivery %, capacity utilization |

For industries not listed, identify the 3-5 metrics that investors and operators use to benchmark performance.

Use these metrics consistently across all competitor comparisons.

### Step 1: Market Context
- Market size (current and projected) with source
- Growth drivers and headwinds
- Key trends reshaping the industry

**CORRECT:** "The embedded payments market is $80-100B in 2024, growing at 20-25% CAGR (McKinsey 2024)"
**WRONG:** "The market is large and growing rapidly"

### Step 2: Industry Economics

Map value flows. Approach varies by industry type:
* **Vertically-structured** — Value chain layers with typical margin at each
* **Platform/network** — Ecosystem participants and value flows between them
* **Fragmented** — Consolidation dynamics and margin differences by scale

### Step 3: Target Company Profile

```
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Revenue | $4.96B |
| Growth | +26% YoY |
| Gross Margin | 45% |
| Profitability | $373M Adj. EBITDA |
| Customers | 134K |
| Retention | 92% |
| Market Share | ~15% |
```

**For multi-segment companies, add segment breakdown:**
```
| Segment | Revenue | Rev YoY | Rev % | EBITDA | EBITDA YoY | Margin |
|---------|---------|---------|-------|--------|------------|--------|
| Seg A   | $25.1B  | +26%    | 57%   | $6.5B  | +31%       | 26%    |
| Seg B   | $13.8B  | +31%    | 31%   | $2.5B  | +64%       | 18%    |
| Seg C   | $5.1B   | -2%     | 12%   | -$74M  | -16%       | -1%    |
| Total   | $44.0B  | +18%    | 100%  | $6.5B* | -          | 15%    |
```
*Note corporate costs if applicable

### Step 4: Competitor Mapping

Group competitors using the framework that fits:
* **By business model** — Platform vs. vertical vs. horizontal
* **By segment** — Enterprise vs. SMB vs. consumer  
* **By posture** — Direct vs. adjacent vs. emerging
* **By origin** — Incumbents vs. disruptors vs. new entrants

### Step 5: Positioning Visualization

| Visualization | Best For |
|--------------|----------|
| 2x2 Matrix | Two dominant competitive factors |
| Radar/Spider | Multi-factor comparison |
| Tier Diagram | Natural clustering/strategic groups |
| Value Chain Map | Vertical industries |
| Ecosystem Map | Platform markets |

### Step 6: Competitor Deep Dives

**Table 1 — Metrics:**
```
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Revenue | $X.XB |
| Growth | +XX% YoY |
| Gross Margin | XX% |
| Market Cap | $X.XB |
| Profitability | $XXXM EBITDA |
| Customers | XXK |
| Retention | XX% |
| Market Share | ~XX% |
```

**Table 2 — Qualitative:**
```
| Category | Assessment |
|----------|------------|
| Business | What they do (1 sentence) |
| Strengths | 2-3 bullets |
| Weaknesses | 2-3 bullets |
| Strategy | Current priorities |
```

### Step 7: Comparative Analysis

```
| Dimension | Company A | Company B | Company C |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Scale | ●●● $160B | ●●○ $45B | ●○○ $8B |
| Growth | ●●○ +26% | ●●● +35% | ●●○ +22% |
| Margins | ●●○ 7.5% | ●○○ 3.2% | ●●● 15% |
```

### Step 8: Strategic Context
- M&A transactions (multiples, strategic rationale)
- Partnership and integration trends
- Capital raising patterns
- Regulatory developments

### Step 9: Synthesis

**Competitive Moat Assessment:**
Evaluate each competitor's durable advantages using these categories:

| Moat Type | What to Assess |
|-----------|----------------|
| Network Effects | Strength of user/supplier flywheel; cross-side vs. same-side effects |
| Switching Costs | Technical integration depth, contractual lock-in, behavioral habits |
| Scale Economies | Unit cost advantages at volume; minimum efficient scale |
| Intangible Assets | Brand value, proprietary data, regulatory licenses, patents |

Rate each as Strong / Moderate / Weak with supporting evidence.

**Required Synthesis Elements:**
- Durable advantages (hard to replicate) — map to moat categories above
- Structural vulnerabilities (hard to fix)
- Current state vs. trajectory

**For investment contexts:**
```
| Scenario | Probability | Key Driver |
|----------|-------------|------------|
| Bull | 30% | Market share gains, margin expansion |
| Base | 50% | Current trajectory continues |
| Bear | 20% | Competitive pressure, margin compression |
```
