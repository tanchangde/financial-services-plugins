## Language Patterns to Avoid

- **Contractions**: Don't → Do not, won't → will not
- **Exclamation points**: Generally inappropriate for IB materials
- **First-person**: "We think..." → "Management believes..." or passive voice
- **Superlatives without evidence**: "best-in-class" requires supporting data
- **Vague quantifiers**: "some", "many", "several" → specific numbers

## Preferred Phrasing Patterns

**Growth narratives**:
- "Demonstrated track record of X% revenue CAGR"
